# Version Checker
Will check all app versions both stable and test to let you know if there is any updates avialble for you.

# Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/ludvigaldrin/com.svipler.athom.version-checker.git
2. cd com.svipler.athom.version-checker
3. npm install
4. homey run app

# Result
When running it you will first se a list of all your apps. It will then start running through all your apps one by one checking for test versions. If it exists your will see a indaction on what app and version. Also a URL to where to download it.

# Comming
Someday I will just integreate this in to a Settings page so you can hit refresh and it will list in the app instead with links. Started doing it but got tired directly since a Settings page cant call methods in the app so I need to redo stuff in web context.
